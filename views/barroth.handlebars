      <p>Barroth are large brute wyverns known for their short tempers and thick skulls. 
        They have an osseous crown which they use to batter anything foolish enough to trespass in their territory.</p>

      <p>Their armored hide is often accompanied by a layer of protective mud. 
        This obscures their form as camouflage and keeps them cool under the wasteland sun.</p>

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p><b>Wildspire Waste</b></p>
      <p>They can be found patrolling the muddy flatlands and resting in their nests located in a shallow, murky pond.</p>

      <h2>Behavior</h2>
      <p>Barroth will antagonize any monster that enters their narrow field of vision. 
        It will let off a shrill whistle, then promptly charge at the unfortunate victim. 
        These monsters will repeat this tactic until exhausted or otherwise incapacitated.</p>

      <p>When the monster is covered in mud, it will shake itself violently to dislodge some of the muck 
        leaving piles of impassable terrain which can easily trap a heavy-footed hunter. Once trapped, 
        one can find themself unable to move while the monster winds up a fatal charge.</p>

      <p>If it finds itself in a constricted area, it will opt for hip checks and body slams to defend itself. 
        Additionally, it can use its mace-like tail to bludgeon rear foes.</p>

      <p>When the mud it uses to protect itself is lost, it will relocate to the nearest body of water to cover itself again.</p>

      <h2>Combat Tactics</h2>
      <p>This brute wyvern is fairly straightforward, assuming a hunter doesn’t find themself waist high in mud. 
        Their tough crown can turn almost any attack, so assault it from the side or rear.</p>

      <p>A simple roll to the side will dodge most of the monster’s attacks. It can even be baited into slamming into rock walls, 
        briefly stunning the creature and providing ample opportunity to retaliate.</p>

      <p>Be mindful of the muck it spreads across the field, and don’t be afraid to force it to a new area, or to wait 
        for the obstacles to dissipate before reengaging. Equipment exists that allows for free movement through muck, 
        if the beast is troubling you try equipping that for your next attempt.</p>

      <p>The mud armor can be tricky to deal with, however the usage of puddlepods or other water elemental attacks can quickly 
        deal with that issue. Once stripped, Barroth becomes susceptible to fire element attacks and can be promptly dealt with.</p>
